'The 91st Parallel' is a top-down pseudo-3d zombie survival game. It was made for the Ludum Dare 27 game jam by Brian MacIntosh. The theme of the game jam was "10 Seconds".  In this case, the theme was interpreted as "10 arc-seconds of latitude".

As this game was made largely from scratch in 48 hours, it probably contains numerous hacks and bad code.
